Completed this project as part of my BI with PowerBI Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Key highlights:

With the given data, first the data is verified,if any errors and rectify it then the data is transformed and modeled using Power BI Desktop, and then published to the Power BI service with advanced features,such as DAX formulas, measures, calculated columns, and custom visuals, to enhance the data analysis and presentation.
